        <h2>All About Stephen</h2>
        <p>I'm Stephen Herd, a web developer with over 20 years of experience in development and more than 35 years of teaching. Early in my career, I worked as an automotive instructor at General Motors, where I taught advanced vehicle diagnostics and electronic systems courses. This experience ignited my passion for teaching, and I eventually earned a Master of Science in Computer Education and Cognitive Systems from the University of North Texas in 2006. After that, I transitioned to teaching Information Technology courses.</p>
        <p>In addition to my teaching career, I've had the opportunity to build websites for non-profit organizations, helping them establish an online presence. I also provide professional development to higher education institutions, supporting faculty and staff in enhancing their technical skills. Currently, I teach Web Development at Dallas College, where I'm able to share my knowledge and help students develop the skills they need to succeed in the tech industry.</p>
        <p>My background in both web development and instructional design allows me to blend technical expertise with effective teaching strategies. I'm passionate about helping students and organizations grow through technology, and I look forward to continuing to contribute to the field of education and web development.</p>
